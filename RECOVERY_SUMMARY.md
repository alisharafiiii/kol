## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test auto-backup manually
./scripts/auto-commit.sh

# View auto-backup schedule
crontab -l

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel
```

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly
2. Make any additional changes needed
3. Commit your changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "Recovery complete"`
4. Deploy to Vercel when ready: `vercel --prod`

## Important Notes

- The Vercel deployment that's currently live is still working
- Auto-backup runs daily at 2 AM
- Always commit before deploying to avoid losing work
