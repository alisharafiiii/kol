# Profile Modal and Role Management Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Modal Not Showing Data
**Problem**: The profile modal was trying to fetch from the new unified profile system which didn't have user data.

**Solution**: 
- Created `/api/user/full-profile` endpoint to fetch complete user data from the old Redis system
- Updated ProfileModal to fetch from both the old user system and new profile system
- Added proper field mappings for social accounts, audience types, chains, etc.

### 2. Role Management in Admin Panel
**Problem**: User roles were displayed but couldn't be edited in the admin panel.

**Solution**:
- Added role dropdown selector to ProfileModal in AdminPanel
- Created `handleRoleChange` function to update user roles via the API
- Added `onRoleChange` prop to ProfileModal component
- Roles can now be changed to: user, viewer, scout, intern, core, admin

## Updated Components

### ProfileModal.tsx
- Replaced lucide-react icons with text symbols for retro aesthetic
- Updated to fetch from `/api/user/full-profile` endpoint
- Added fields for audience types, chains, and primary language
- Fixed social media data structure to match Redis schema

### AdminPanel.tsx
- Added role editing dropdown in ProfileModal
- Added `handleRoleChange` function to update roles
- Role changes are saved back to Redis immediately
